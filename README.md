## General Information

In this project, we create a `Kitten` model and `KittensController` for all 7 RESTful actions. We setup the routing and views for these actions.

Rails makes it easy to return either HTML or JSON depending on the request. We setup our `KittensController` to be able to return JSON for the `#index` and `#show` routes. We now have a simple API where users can request information from our app.
